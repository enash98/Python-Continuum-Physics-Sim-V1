# Python-Continuum-Physics-Sim-V1
A framework built in Python for simulating Continuum Physics in 2D.
Including simulations for:
* Fluids (Thermal Hydraulics) -- Numerical solver for the Incompressible Navier-Stokes, including fluid temperature
* Heat Conduction, or Diffusion within "static" Gases -- Numerical solver for the heat equation, with sourcing
* Quantum Wavefunctions -- Numerical solver for the Schrodinger equation (Work in progress)

This framework takes advantage of Object Oriented Programming concepts to provide more versatile simulations, in contrast to my previous fluid simulations (FS-V1,V2,V3)

The boundary conditions are fully configurable: one can choose Dirichlet (fixed value) or Neumann (fixed normal derivative) conditions for the fields on each of the 4 boundaries.

I plan to coninue to add new simulations to this frame work.
